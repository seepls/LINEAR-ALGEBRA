  determinant is defined for square matrices .
  
  few application of determinants are : 
  1. cross product of two vectors in R^n can be defined using determinant of n*n matrix
  2. volume of parallelpiped formed by any 3 non zero vectors in R^3
  3.used in change of variables in integrals in calculus 
  4. used to find eigen values of matrix
  5. determinant of a matrix can tell us about the invertibility of matrix , and number of solution etc .
