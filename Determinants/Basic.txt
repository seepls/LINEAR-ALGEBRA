  determinant is defined for square matrices .
  
  few application of determinants are : 
  1. cross product of two vectors in R^n can be defined using determinant of n*n matrix
  2. volume of parallelpiped formed by any 3 non zero vectors in R^3
  3.used in change of variables in integrals in calculus 
  4. used to find eigen values of matrix
  5. determinant of a matrix can tell us about the invertibility of matrix , and number of solution etc .
  
  
Determinants is a function which as an input accepts  n*n matrix and output is real or complex number that is called determinant of the input Matrix .

1.Inverse of a matrix : transpose of matrix formed by Respective cofactor .
A. Adj(A) = Det(A) *I3 

A^-1 = Adj(A) / Det(A) ;
