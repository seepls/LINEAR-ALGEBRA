Determinants can be used to find equation of line , curves and surfaces passing through fixed points.
simple application being :
1. given two points find equation of line 
2. given three points , find equation of circle passing through these points
3. also according to kepler's law asteroids move around sun in ellipse so how many points on the ellipse 
do u need to find the equation of ellipse?

in three dimensional space how many points needed to define a plane ?? 
how do we find the equation of plane passing through three points ?
finding equation of sphere passing through 4 given points
