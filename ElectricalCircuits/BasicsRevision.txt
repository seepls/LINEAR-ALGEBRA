Current : (I) measured in amperes 
Resistance :(R) measured in ohms 
Electrical potential difference : (V) measured in volts 

three basic law govern the flow of current in an electrical circuit :

1.ohm's law 
2.Kirchoff's voltage law 
3.Kirchoff's current law 

simple circuits categorized in two kinds 
1.series 
2.parallel


we form enough number of equation using the laws and solve using linear algebra : )
