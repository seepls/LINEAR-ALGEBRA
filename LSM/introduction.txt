Least Square approximation :
in general you can construct a polynomial of degree n that passes through n specified points .
such a polynomial is called interpolating polynomial .


inconsistent system often arise in application.scientists try to find a functional relationship between variables .
they collect data that usually involve experimental error . and by studying this data or by other findings , they suggest 
a mathematical model for it 
" functional relationship between variables "
because of the measurement error , a polynomial that passes through all given points is not the true representation
of relationship between variables . a lower degree polynomial may represent the relationship better 
the variables.
